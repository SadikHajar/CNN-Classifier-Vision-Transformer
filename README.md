# Computer Vision Workshop README

## Objective
The main objective of this workshop is to explore various neural architectures for computer vision tasks using the PyTorch library, including CNN, RCNN, FCNN, and ViT.

## Part 1: CNN Classifier
- Implement a CNN architecture using PyTorch for classifying the MNIST dataset.
- Compare CNN performance with Faster R-CNN.
- Evaluate both models using metrics like accuracy, F1 score, loss, and training time.
- Fine-tune pre-trained VGG16 and AlexNet models on the MNIST dataset and compare results with CNN and Faster R-CNN.

## Part 2: Vision Transformer (VIT)
- Implement a Vision Transformer (ViT) model from scratch using PyTorch.
- Perform classification on the MNIST dataset with ViT.
- Compare the performance of ViT with models from Part 1.
